# drawShapes
this project can be used to draw triangles lines and points
What frustrated me about this project was trying to work with buffers which was something I
had never done before, as well as making sure everything executed in the correct order
The biggest place i remember getting stuck was figuring out the Uint16Array for the triangles.
the most satisfying part of this project was the feeling I got when I finished. The project was quite difficult,
and we were given little instruction. many of my fellow students dropped the class after being unable to complete this project
so when I finally finished i just felt extremely satisfied

my contributions were pretty much everything in the square.js and square.html files
